# A-B-Testing

### Results
The project successfully identified and analyzed customer churn rates across different retention strategies. The implementation of the Gradient Boosting model achieved an accuracy of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting churn. The churn rates for the two strategies were observed to be 20.05% for Strategy A and 20.69% for Strategy B, indicating slight variations in their effectiveness. The A/B testing revealed actionable insights that can guide marketing and retention efforts.

### Novelty of the Project
This project is novel as it combines advanced machine learning techniques with A/B testing to address customer retention in a data-driven manner. By utilizing Gradient Boosting, a robust predictive modeling approach, the project provides a deeper understanding of the factors influencing customer churn. Additionally, the focus on testing multiple retention strategies allows for tailored approaches based on data insights, a relatively underexplored area in traditional churn analysis.

### Strategies and Reasons
1. **Implementation of A/B Testing**: This strategy was employed to directly compare the effectiveness of two different retention strategies. The rationale behind this approach is to derive clear insights into which strategy yields better results, thereby enabling data-driven decision-making.

2. **Use of Predictive Modeling**: By leveraging the Gradient Boosting algorithm, the project aimed to predict churn more accurately. This strategy was chosen because of its ability to handle complex datasets and capture non-linear relationships, which are often present in customer behavior data.

3. **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Analyzing customer data to identify patterns and trends was crucial for formulating the retention strategies. This strategy ensured that decisions were based on empirical evidence rather than assumptions, maximizing the potential for successful outcomes.

Overall, the project aimed to enhance customer retention through informed strategies, contributing to improved business performance and customer satisfaction.
